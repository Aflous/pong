# Pong Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using the Pygame library.

### How to Play
The game is played by two players. Each player controls a paddle using the arrow keys (up and down for player one, and W and S for player two). The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it past the other player's paddle.

The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined number of points (by default 7). The player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.

### Dependencies
This game requires the Pygame library to be installed. You can install it using pip:
```zsh
pip install pygame
```



### Running the Game
To run the game, simply run the main.py file:

```zsh
python app/main.py
```

### Customization
The game can be customized by changing various constants in the constants.py file. These include the size of the window, the speed of the ball and paddles, and the winning score.
